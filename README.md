# TinyJIT
A lightweight JIT compiler for tensor operations that uses LLVM to generate effecient machine code. 

features; 
 -  define tensor operations
 - automatic construction of computational graphs 
 - support for various mathematical operation (let's say high school level)
 - JIT compilation to native code 


--- This project is just for fun and to learn more about compilers ^^
